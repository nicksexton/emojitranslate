    "We trained the LSTM model (A 256 unit LSTM straight into a softmax output layer) on $2^{18}$ (262,144) Tweets. That might not seem like many, but remember each tweet needs 32 training examples (with a windowsize of 64 and a max length of 160 characters) so that's about 8.3 million training examples. Running on an AWS p3.2xlarge instance (on a Tesla V100 GPU) it took about 20 minutes per epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training took part in two stages (not planned, this was just how it turned out) - first it was trained only on the first half of that data for about 30 epochs. After it looked like the model was starting to over-fit (but without looking like it had got the hang of generating tweets) so I doubled the size of the training set, and ran it for another 10-12 epochs or so.\n",
    "\n",
    "I say 'looking like' - throughout the training process, I had the model generate a few tweets based on some seed text (randomly pulled in from a tweet) at various settings of the temperature parameter, and eyeballed the resulting gibberish to get a feel for how far through training the model was.\n",
    "\n",
    "I later realised that this wasn't a particularly good check on the model's ability to generate coherent English language tweets - it seems as though the model is particularly sensitive to what is in the seed text and how much of it it gets. So generating based on 10 or 20 seed characters gets very different results to generating based on 64 seed characters. In an ideal world, we do want the model to be able to freely generate coherent tweets based on a minimal seed (ideally, just an emoji). However, in this notebook we'll take a more detailed look at what's going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading up the Twitter dataset that we trained the model on, and the global variables that we used to set the size of the sets."
